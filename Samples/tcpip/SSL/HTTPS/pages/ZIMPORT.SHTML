ZImport.lib and the #zimport directive can be used to compress files
so that they take up less storage space.  These files can be uncompressed
on-the-fly by the web server.
<P>
For example, perhaps you'd like to read <A HREF="alice.html">Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland</A>?  (original size: 154514; compressed size:
<!--#echo var="text_size"-->)
<P>
Or maybe see an illustration of the <A HREF="alice.jpg">White Rabbit</A>?
(original size: 7149; compressed size: <!--#echo var="image_size"-->)
<P>
Note that text compresses very well, but images do not compress well at
all.  In this case, the overhead involved in the compression scheme
outweighs any benefits, so that the compressed file is actually
<i>larger</i> than the original.  You should keep this in mind when
determining which data files to compress.
