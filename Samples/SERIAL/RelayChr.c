     This program receives characters in port B and relays them
     out port C.
     It must be run with a serial utility such as Hyperterminal.
     
     Connect RS232 cable from PC to Rabbit:
     	 Connect PC's RS232 GND to Rabbit GND
       Connect PC's RS232 TD  to Rabbit RXB
       Connect PC's RS232 RD  to Rabbit TXC
	  With a second serial cable from the PC to the Rabbit:
     	 Connect PC's RS232 GND to Rabbit GND
       Connect PC's RS232 TD  to Rabbit RXC
       Connect PC's RS232 RD  to Rabbit TXC
       
     Configure the serial utility on both serial ports to RS232, 19200 8N1.
     
     Run this program.
     Run Hyperterminal.
     Type characters into the serial utility window.
      
     This program will echo characters sent from the serial utility back 
     to the serial utility where they will appear in its send/receive window.
